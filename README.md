So I did this Coursera to learn how to use Java spring framework and how to port it into the Google cloud.

[https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-cloud-java-spring/](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-cloud-java-spring/)

I completed the course, but I feel I need a million years to really understand what I did or understand how to use Spring. Normally I don't put courses I feel will not help me in any way or disliked, but this one fucked me. Last time I did any linux shell commands was 2001 or 2002 and never touched that again. This one gave me Impostor Syndrome, so I'll keep it here until I maybe one day learn how those really work. I'll be busy learning something more useful and less challenging like Quadtrees.


This is not an official Google project.

This repository contains example code for the Spring Cloud GCP lab.

The instructions for the course are in [bit.ly/spring-gcp-lab](http://bit.ly/spring-gcp-lab)
